            I highly recommend working with Jason! I had a session with him to
            prepare for my marketing interviews. He got in touch and asked for
            my CV for his preparation. During the session, I felt that he
            genuinely cared about helping me. He didn't just want me to ace the
            interviews but also wanted to make sure that I would get the right
            job that truly matches what I want. He is insightful and just simply
            kind. The session ended up giving me more than guidance for
            interviews but a direction to build my career in marketing. I spoke
            with him on Tuesday for my Thursday interview and I received an
            offer on Friday!

            Very Highly recommended! I have been working with Jason for just
            under 9 months now and he has been an invaluable asset to me and my
            start-up. Before finding him I worked with other 3 mentor figures
            and the difference was abysmal, for the first time I had somebody
            that was actually interested in seeing me succeed and not just the
            pay. During one of our meetings Jason told me 'My biggest success is
            your success' I don't think there is much more you can ask. Jason
            has become a person that I can rely on and trust, I would go as far
            as to say that my company would not be where it is today if it were
            not for Jason. He is extremely knowledgeable, and up to date with
            the latest information, and when he is not, he is very transparent
            about his level of expertise in a particular matter. In addition to
            his vast practical knowledge, he always makes me feel like I am able
            to accomplish what we set out to do; and even when I inevitably make
            mistakes he is always ready with a more tragic story to help me put
            things in perspective and find the fuel to keep on going. Working
            with Jason has been one of the best business decisions I have made,
            and I am sure it will be the same also for you. Best of luck, Carla
          </p>

            I really like interacting with Jason, he has a ton of advantageous
            knowledge. He is always up to date with techniques and strategies.
            He basically helped me to build an online business. If I am stuck he
            can always suggest a solution or an alternative easier way. He is
            very good at troubleshooting. Recommend.
