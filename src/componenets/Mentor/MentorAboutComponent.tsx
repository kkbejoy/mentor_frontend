        <p className="text-gray-600">
          I am a seasoned digital marketing expert with a vast amount of
          experience to share with you.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          During my career I have been the Head of Paid Marketing in one of the
          biggest marketing agencies in the UK with more than 140 employees. I
          have helped people grow their skillsets and achieve both their
          professional and personal goals through mentoring and guiding them
          when they needed it. Being responsible for the hiring process of the
          agency I am able to give you detailed information on how to ace any
          interview and how to get your dream job if this is one of your goals.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          I have worked with clients from a wide variety of industries with some
          notable names being BNTM (Britain's Next Top Model), Noble Foods, The
          Happy Egg Company, TUI, Melia and many others. I am here to share what
          I learned from working for those multi-billion dollar companies so you
          can apply that knowledge to your day-to-day work.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          I have also been both a lecturer and the Managing Partner at an online
          educational institution which allows me to guide you through any
          academic challenges you might be having and help you hit any
          objectives you might have set for yourself.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          I have a Master's degree in Management from a Russel Group University
          (University of Nottingham) and a Bachelor's in Computer Science
          meaning that I am able to help with you any technical challenges you
          might have as well.
